## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Meheraank/swen.io/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Meheraank/swen.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

I am Meheraan Khan. I attended Stuyvesant High School, which is a school in Manhattan. One of my favorite things to do in my freetime is play soccer with my friends. I typiclly  
like staying indoors. Because of the pandemic, my fitness drastically decreased so recently I have made the decision to start going to the gym and getting back to my old self. 
Overall, I'm just an average human with nothing particularly exciting going on at the moment.
